This is a work in progress. I'm putting it on the back-burner while I focus on my job hunt.

Still on the todo list:
- Manage comments
- Manage API errors helpfully
- Disallow users without author or admin roles
- Update password
- Registration form
- Delete post with dependent comments
- Delete user with dependent posts or comments
- Hide the current user dropdown when user clicks elsewhere
- Put something interesting on the main page
